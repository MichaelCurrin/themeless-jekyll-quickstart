All the styling and assets are included in this repo. This gives you more control and configuring a theme. But it means the repo is heavy - including both your own content and the appearance setup.

## Purpose

This project is based on following the [Jekyll Step-by-Step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) and serves the following purposes:

- Create a project quickly from this one, using the _Use this template_ button.
- This is a reference for other projects.
- There is demo site hosted as a _GitHub Pages_ site.

Note that this project has **no** theme. If you want to see use of a theme in a simple project, see these projects:

- [MichaelCurrin/jekyll-blog-demo](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-blog-demo)
- [jekyll-themed-site-quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-themed-site-quickstart)

This project demonstrates how to do a few things in Jekyll, but the approaches are not necessarily best practice. See [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) project for a good idea of how to set up a navbar, styling, JS, includes files and other pieces which are more typical of Jekyll sites and easier to scale and maintain.

### Turn your HTML assets into a Jekyll project

This project is a good starting point if you have some existing HTML and CSS that you've built or downloaded as a theme and now you want to build a Jekyll site from it to make it easy to maintain. As you'll get to use a config file and layouts for templating plus you can use the included gems like Jekyll sitemap to handle SEO for you.

This project has limited styling and does not use a theme gem, so it is good to use. 

You can easily make a new project from this template and replace the layouts with content from an existing folder of static HTML. Add any includes files you need like `head.html`, `analytics.html` or `gallery.html`. Delete or rename the pages.

You can add CSS as external content in the head tag or as CSS files on the repo.


## About this project

The contents of this project shows how to work with [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby gem for generating static sites).

The _frontmatter_ (HTML and markdown content) pages are built with the template engine to produce HTML which is served. In this case, the output is kept simple - a few pages, each with a navigation bar that has current page highlighted.

### Theme

Usually a _Jekyll theme_ is used for static sites so they can have styling, then you override the sections you want. However this project has **no** theme set.

### How this project is structured

- Navigation bar using configured a [navigation.html](/_data/navigation.yml) data file and rendered using [navigation.html](/_includes/navigation.html) file.
- Blog [page](/blog.html) and [posts](/_posts).
- Blog post authors are in the [\_authors](_authors/) directory, enabled as a collection in [config](_config.yml) and then referenced by blog post with an `author` field.
- Skills are listed in the [skills.yml](/_data/skills.yml) data file and are iterated over in the [my_skills.md](/my_skills.md) page.
- The [\_layouts](/_layouts/) directory has a few layouts and these are matched to pages using the [config](/_config.yml) file.
- [Plugins](#plugins) are set in the [Gemfile](/Gemfile) and [config](/_config.yml).

#### Collections note

A note on generating pages as a collection. Each author markdown file generate its own author page because of the setup above. When iterating, you can use the default ordering, or use a Jekyll filter to order them or reverse them or you could add a priority (or order or weight) field in each to sort by (e.g. sort by this value ascending where `1` would mean 1st position).

This cannot unfortunately be done using a single YAML data file. Unless you use a plugin, or generate markdown files from a CSV as suggested in this [Jekyll issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2983) conversation.

### Resources

- Some useful links which helped me with learning how to use Jekyll are in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/dfd14bfa74938e40f251bc00445a1627).


## Deploy

This project can be setup on GitHub Pages.

Do this by setting up GitHub Pages section of the GitHub repo's _Settings_.

This project is available at:

- [michaelcurrin.github.io/themeless-jekyll-quickstart](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/themeless-jekyll-quickstart/ "Go to demo site")

Since this is a project page, the subpath of `themeless-jekyll-quickstart` is automatically set using the repo's name. In order to keep navigation and asset URLs in line with this and prevent errors, the `baseurl` in the [config](/_config.yml) file is also set to that subpath.


## Installation

Set up the project locally - instructions are for _Linux_ or _macOS_ systems.

### Clone

Optionally addd this to your own repos - either fork this repo or click this button to get a copy .[![Use this template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Use_this_template-2ea44f)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/themeless-jekyll-quickstart/generate).

Then clone your repo or this one.

Navigate to the repo's root directory locally.

You can view commands in the [Makefile](/Makefile) or skip that and continue.

```bash
$ make help
```

### Install system dependencies

Install Ruby and Bundler - see [instructions](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/fb758aea4d35e03b9ed093afddf4e7ec).

### Install project packages

Install gems for your project - including Jekyll.

```bash
$ make install
```

Run this command in future to upgrade to the latest gems.

```bash
$ make upgrade
```

The `Gemfile.lock` file will be updated if there were any changes. You can commit this. That file is optional for GitHub Pages, but required if you want to deploy to Netlify.


## Run

Build to the `_site` directory and start the Jekyll dev server.

### On subpath

Set `baseurl` value in the config - this should be changed to match the repo name. This makes it easy to mirror how sites [run on Github Pages](#run-on-github-pages).

```bash
$ make serve
```

Open the browser at:

- http://localhost:4000/static-pages-demo

### On root path

```bash
$ make serve-root
```

Open the browser at:

- http://localhost:4000/


## Production build

When building site content to deploy to production, replace the default `'development'` value with `production`.

```bash
$ make build
```

This will affect any checks in the files such as `if jekyll.environment == "production"`. This is useful for example to only show Google Analytics tag on Production site.

Then copy the contents of the `_site` directory to your server and then serve the static content. GitHub Pages and Netlify can do the build, copy, and serve steps for you all in the cloud. 


## Plugins

The following plugins were recommended as part of the [deploy step](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/10-deployment/) of the Jekyll tutorial tutorial and so are used in this project in both the [gem file](/Gemfile) and [Jekyll config](/_config.yml).

- **jekyll-sitemap** - Creates a robots and sitemap file, to help search engines index content.
- **jekyll-feed** - Creates an RSS feed for your posts. This is typically shown on as link  in the header or footer.
- **jekyll-seo-tag** - Makes meta tag snippets available, to help with SEO.

### Sitemap

The first doesn't need any setup other than in the two files mentioned above. Serving the site will give following:

- http://localhost:4000/robots.txt
- http://localhost:4000/sitemap.xml

### Feed and SEO Tag

The other two plugins have been added to the [defaults](_layouts/default.html) file as `{% feed_meta %}` and `{% seo %}` tags in the head (view the source of any page to see the result). If using a theme like `minima`, you will find that those are already included in the theme's default layout.

The RSS Feed is available here:

- http://localhost:4000/feed.xml

If not overriding the configured `baseurl`, the paths of all pages (including the feed and sitemap) will be off of the subpath. The links inside the feed and sitemap files will reflect that too.
